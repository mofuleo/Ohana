      <h1>What is Cc60?</h1>


      <p>Cc60 stands for cell, smooth, and 60 trillion.
        It is a small, round metal device that fits in one hand, and is said to have the ability to affect the 60 trillion cells in the human body.
        By gently rolling this round sphere from the soles of your feet to the top of your head, you can stimulate lymphatic flow.</p>

      <h2>Features of Cc60 Treatment</h2>
      <h3>✔︎All treatments are performed while fully clothed.</h3>
      <h3>✔︎As a general rule, the whole body is treated.</h3>
      <p>For example, stiff shoulders can have many different causes, such as eye strain, overworked arms, body
        distortion, and poor blood circulation throughout the body. Therefore, treatment around the shoulder alone will
        not bring about sufficient recovery. Through full-body treatment, we correct problems and bring the whole body
        back to health.</p>

      <h3>✔︎You may feel pain</h3>
      <p>This is a light rubbing treatment using Cc60, but you may feel pain as the stray currents and waste products
        accumulated in your body are removed (you may also feel a rusty odor at the same time as the pain).</p>
